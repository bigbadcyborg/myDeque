A double-ended queue allows efficient insertion and removal of elements at both the front and the back. Its templated nature makes it highly versatile, supporting any data type while maintaining strong performance characteristics.

		Dynamic Resizing:
	•	Unlike std::vector, which only allows fast access and modification at the back, std::deque provides efficient operations at both ends, making it ideal for applications like sliding window problems, BFS in graphs, or task scheduling.
		Efficient Memory Management:
	•	Instead of allocating a contiguous block of memory like std::vector, std::deque uses a segmented array approach. This minimizes the need to reallocate and copy the entire data structure when growing.
		General Purpose:
	•	It supports random access like std::vector and also fast insertion/removal from either end like a linked list, making it versatile for a wide range of scenarios.
		Templated Flexibility:
	•	Being templated allows the container to work with any type of data, including user-defined types, without rewriting the implementation.

How std::deque Works Internally

The implementation of std::deque combines the benefits of dynamic arrays and linked lists through a segmented memory architecture:

		Memory Layout:
	•	std::deque is made up of chunks (blocks) of contiguous memory, managed by a central array of pointers (a “map”).
	•	These blocks store the actual data, and the map allows the deque to efficiently locate them.
		Dynamic Growth:
	•	When elements are added to the front or back, new blocks are dynamically allocated, and the map is updated to include them.
	•	This avoids the need for massive memory reallocations, unlike std::vector.
		Insertion and Deletion:
	•	Insertions and deletions at the front or back involve only a small number of operations, such as updating the map and modifying block pointers.
	•	Middle insertions are less efficient, as they may require shifting elements within blocks.
		Random Access:
	•	For accessing elements by index, std::deque calculates the block containing the element and its position within the block. This makes random access O(1), similar to std::vector.
